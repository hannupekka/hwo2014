# hwo2014

My participation for [Hello World Open 2014](https://helloworldopen.com/). 

## Why?
I decided to join the competition using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) because I had absolutely no experience with it before this. This way I'd get at least something (besides entertainment) out of it, since I wasn't really confident about winning.

## Results
My bot with almost no physics finished at place 140 of 856 in R2 (Europe & Africa).
